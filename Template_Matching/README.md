# Template Matching 

Template Matching is a  computer vision challenge where an algorithm is trying to find similarities between two or more different images. 


# Where is Waldo ?

Waldo is hiding somewhere and lets find out waldo from all the noise and distraction !!!!

Lets use Computer Vision to find waldo in seconds , which might take years if we are using Human Eye. 

## Aim : 

** Python script is written to find Waldo in puzzle. That is given a query image of Waldo and a puzzle image, we have to find 
waldo in the puzzle image and highlight waldo's location

## What I learnt: 

** How to use template matching, OpenCV and python to find a specific target in a image. 

## Requirements: 

** Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda), NumPy, OpenCV.
