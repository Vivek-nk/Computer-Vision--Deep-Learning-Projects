# Binary classification using gradient descent optimization method

## Abstract:

Given 1000 data points X with two classes 0 and 1. In this program , I have designed a binary classifier:

𝑌Hat = 𝜎(𝑊^T * 𝑥 + 𝑏)

Where,

W is weight, b is bias and 𝜎(𝑍) =1 / (1+ 𝑒^𝑧)

Here gradient descent optimization method is used to iteratively improve weights and bias and obtain high classification accuracy.
