# Comparison of Convolutional Neural Networks 


Lets compare the performance of various Neural Network. Flower17 data set is used for classification using various Convolutional Neural Network. 


## Data-set
We have a 17 category flower dataset with 80 images for each class. The flowers chosen are some common flowers in the UK. The images have large scale, pose and light variations and there are also classes with large varations of images within the class and close similarity to other classes. The categories can be seen in the figure below. We randomly split the dataset into 3 different training, validation and test sets. A subset of the images have been groundtruth labelled for segmentation.
